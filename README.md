# portal-sdk-2013
Portal source code ported to Source SDK 2013

The source code has not been modified, that is, it is as is. Do not ask any questions related to programming in C++, as I can not call myself a professional programmer.
This source code is for you to create your own mods. You have no right to sell this modification anywhere if you are not a licensee.

## How to setup source code

1. Clone or download repository.
2. Run `creategameprojects.bat` and open games.sln (you need Visual Studio 2013 with MFC installed to create and open sln-file).
3. Start building the project and then copy the dll files from the `game\portal\bin` to the `your_mod_folder\bin` or you can set up Post Build Events.

To make mods you should to use **Source SDK Singleplayer 2013** with `upcoming` beta.
You can use `gameinfo.txt` from `mod_portal` folder;
