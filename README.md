This code is only for creating your mods, but not more. It is forbidden to sell your modification.

## How to setup source code

1. Clone or download repository.
2. Run `creategameprojects.bat` and open games.sln (you need Visual Studio 2013 with MFC installed to create and open sln-file)
3. Start building the project and then copy the dll files from the `game\portal\bin` to the `your_mod_folder\bin` or you can set up Post Build Events.
